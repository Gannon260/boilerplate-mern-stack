Progress Residential is eager to move on with a second round of interviews. As part of our interview process we would like to have you complete a tech assignment (see below). Due to busy schedules, we like to give a week for candidates to complete. This is something that should only take a couple of evenings to finish, with an extra credit section for candidates who really want to show off their skills.

Please let us know if we can set up the 2nd round with our tech lead.
Looking forward to hearing back from you.
